## Notes (in case you needed them)

* **74HC595** is a chip that converts serial data into a byte. You send serial data through the **DS** port, and the output bits can be read from **Q0** to **Q7** ports. To write the bits, you first set **ST_CP** to *LOW*. Then, for each bit, you set **SH_CP** to *LOW*, write the bit to **DS**, and then set **SH_CP** to *HIGH*. Once you've written all bits, set **ST_CP** to *HIGH* to update the output ports.
* The **QE** port on the **74HC595** needs to be grounded to enable output ports.
